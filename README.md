# SparkComparingDataframes

The code is a comparison between two spark dataframes, sometimes we need to reformat or optimize the code or even migrate from another stack, for those occasions, we need to compare the old dataframe loaded into the Delta lake (for example) to the new one from the new code. For that reason below we can see how the code was idealized on a flowchart showing the steps taken.
